# rest-country-api FrontEnd Mentor Challenge

A challenge from [frontEnd challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

Any feedback is welcome to improve my code.

## The Challenge

The challenge is to integrate with the REST Countries API to pull country data and display it like in the designs.
Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode (optional)
